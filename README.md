## Overview

As scientific fields increasingly adopt FAIR data principles, ontologies have become essential for encoding the semantics of scientific investigations. Yet evaluating ontology quality remains a manual, technically demanding bottleneck. Current frameworks emphasize structural correctness but fail to assess practical utility against the real-world queries posed by domain scientists.

OntoCheck is an open-source Python tool that unifies domain-agnostic structural metrics with a novel, query-driven assessment methodology. By analyzing SPARQL queries derived from natural-language competency questions, OntoCheck compares the required query terms against an ontology's full vocabulary to yield complementary metrics for vocabulary coverage and utilization density. This empowers domain scientists and data engineers to make evidence-based decisions about ontology selection without requiring deep expertise in formal knowledge representation.

OntoCheck is actively developed and maintained by the **SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University**.

## Installation

OntoCheck is available as a PyPI package: [https://pypi.org/project/OntoCheck/](https://pypi.org/project/OntoCheck/)

```bash
pip install OntoCheck
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.8 or later.

### Optional OWL reasoning

Benchmarks can classify a class hierarchy with [hermitpy](https://github.com/lamng3/hermitpy), a Python reasoner for a documented OWL fragment. Its [API reference](https://github.com/lamng3/hermitpy/blob/main/docs/index.html) lists `Reasoner`, the exceptions, and the supported OWL fragment. Install that package from a checkout next to this repository, then select the `hermit` inference profile:

```bash
pip install -e ../hermitpy
```

hermitpy is not published on PyPI yet. Install the local checkout above; the `hermit` extra in `pyproject.toml` only records that dependency name.

```json
"inference": { "profile": "hermit" }
```

Suites that use `none` or `graph_path` do not load hermitpy. The fragment covers subclass, equivalence, disjointness, complement, intersection, union, existential and universal restrictions, inverses, and transitive or symmetric object properties. Datatypes, cardinality, property chains, nominals, and SWRL raise an error instead of being ignored.

## How It Works

OntoCheck takes a declarative configuration `C = (O, Q, M)`, where:

- **O** — Ontology: one or more ontology files under evaluation (`.ttl`).  Multiple files are merged automatically for cross-domain assessment.
- **Q** — Questions: competency questions encoded as SPARQL queries (`.json` or `.md`).  When provided, task-based Recall and Precision are computed automatically.
- **M** — Metrics: the task-agnostic evaluation metrics to compute (structural, labeling, accessibility, naming).

Users select which metrics to run and, optionally, provide competency questions — there is no need to choose a "mode."

## Quick Start

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Display available options
ontocheck -h

# Run specific task-agnostic metrics
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl --metrics altLabelCheck definitionCheck

# Run all task-agnostic metrics
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl --metrics all

# Run an executable benchmark suite
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl \
    --benchmark path/to/benchmark.json \
    --benchmark-output benchmark_results.json

# Task-based assessment (Recall / Precision)
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl \
    --questions competency_questions.json \
    --domain-prefixes mds

# Combined: task-based + all agnostic metrics
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl \
    --metrics all \
    --questions competency_questions.json \
    --domain-prefixes mds

# Cross-domain: merge multiple ontologies
ontocheck xrd.ttl capacitors.ttl \
    --questions cross_domain_questions.json \
    --domain-prefixes mds

# Custom output paths
ontocheck path/to/ontology.ttl --metrics all --log-file results.log --csv-file results.csv
```

### Python API

```python
from ontocheck import run_assessment

# Run specific task-agnostic metrics
run_assessment(
    ttl_files="path/to/ontology.ttl",
    metrics=["altLabelCheck", "definitionCheck", "isolatedElements"],
)

# Task-based assessment (Recall / Precision)
result = run_assessment(
    ttl_files="path/to/ontology.ttl",
    questions="competency_questions.json",
    domain_prefixes=["mds"],
    domain_ns_fragments=["cwrusdle.bitbucket.io/mds"],
)
print(f"Recall: {result['recall']:.2%}")
print(f"Precision:  {result['precision']:.2%}")

# Combined: task-based + all agnostic metrics
result = run_assessment(
    ttl_files="path/to/ontology.ttl",
    metrics="all",
    questions="competency_questions.json",
    domain_prefixes=["mds"],
)

# Cross-domain: merge multiple ontologies
result = run_assessment(
    ttl_files=["xrd.ttl", "capacitors.ttl"],
    questions="cross_domain_questions.json",
    domain_prefixes=["mds"],
)
```

## Available Task-Agnostic Metrics

OntoCheck provides **17 task-agnostic metrics** organized into four categories, along with a **task-based assessment methodology**.

### Labeling

| Metric | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `checkLabel` | `mainLabelCheck_v_0_0_1` | Proportion of named classes carrying human-readable identifiers |
| `altLabelCheck` | `mainAltLabelCheck_v_0_0_1` | Proportion of named classes carrying synonyms |
| `definitionCheck` | `mainDefCheck_v_0_0_1` | Proportion of named classes carrying formal definitions |

### Structural

| Metric | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `isolatedElements` | `check_for_isolated_elements` | Identifies orphaned classes within the ontology |
| `classConnections` | `count_class_connected_components` | Identifies disconnected subgraphs |
| `missingDomainRange` | `get_properties_missing_domain_and_range` | Identifies undeclared domain and range restrictions |
| `leafNodeCheck` | `mainLeafNodeCheck_v_0_0_1` | Identifies all leaf nodes in the ontology hierarchy |
| `semanticConnection` | `mainSemanticConnection_v_0_0_1` | Verifies grounding in upper-level ontologies (e.g., CCO, BFO) |

### Accessibility

| Metric | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sparqlEndpoint` | `check_sparql_accessibility_ttl` | Verifies reachability of the SPARQL endpoint |
| `rdfDump` | `check_rdf_dump_accessibility_ttl` | Verifies availability of the RDF data dump |
| `humanLicense` | `check_human_readable_license_ttl` | Verifies presence and fitness of licensing information |
| `externalLinks` | `check_external_data_provider_links_ttl` | Checks validity of external links within the ontology |

### Naming Convention

| Metric | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `classCapitalCheck` | `mainClassNameCapitalCheck_v_0_0_1` | Flags departures from standard capitalization |
| `classSpaceCheck` | `mainClassNameSpaceCheck_v_0_0_1` | Flags use of spaces in class identifiers |
| `spellCheck` | `spell_check_v_0_0_1` | Spell checking on labels and definitions |
| `duplicateLabels` | `find_duplicate_labels_from_graph` | Identifies duplicate labels across entities |
| `searchClass` | `mainClassSearch_v_0_0_1` | Identifies classes matching a user-specified string |

### Task-Based Assessment

The task-based methodology measures how well an ontology supports analytical queries by computing two complementary metrics from SPARQL competency questions:

- **Recall** = |T_a intersection T_o| / |T_a| -- the fraction of task-required terms that the ontology defines
- **Precision** = |T_a intersection T_o| / |T_o| -- the fraction of ontology terms utilized by the task queries

where T_a is the set of domain terms extracted from the SPARQL queries and T_o is the set of domain terms defined in the ontology.

## OntoCheck is Built for the Community

OntoCheck is conceived as a community resource: we actively encourage collaboration, contribution of new metrics, and submission of domain competency question sets, in the shared interest of building robust, reusable semantic infrastructure for FAIR scientific data.
